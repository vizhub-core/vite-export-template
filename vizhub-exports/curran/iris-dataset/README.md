This is the "Iris" dataset. Originally published at
[UCI Machine Learning Repository: Iris Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris),
this small dataset from 1936 is often used for testing out
machine learning algorithms and visualizations (for example,
[Scatter Plot](http://bl.ocks.org/curran/9e04ccfebeb84bcdc76c)).
Each row of the table represents an iris flower, including
its species and dimensions of its botanical parts, sepal and
petal, in centimeters.

The HTML page provides the basic code required to load the
data and display it on the page (as JSON).

You can import this dataset in your viz like this:

```js
import { data } from '@curran/iris-dataset';
```

As an example of that kind of import, see
